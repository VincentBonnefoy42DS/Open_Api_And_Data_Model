    description: "**TMF API Reference : TMF - 621 Trouble Ticket**\n\n**Release : 19.0\
    \ - June 2019**\n\nThe Trouble Ticket API provides a standardized client interface\
    \ to Trouble Ticket Management Systems for creating, tracking and managing trouble\
    \ tickets as a result of an issue or problem identified by a customer or another\
    \ system. \nExamples of Trouble Ticket API originators (clients) include CRM applications,\
    \ network management or fault management systems, or other Trouble Ticket management\
    \ systems (e.g. B2B).\n\nThe API supports the ability to send requests to create\
    \ a new trouble ticket specifying the nature and severity of the trouble or issue\
    \ as well as all necessary related information. The API also includes mechanisms\
    \ to search for and update existing trouble tickets. Notifications are defined\
    \ to provide information when a trouble ticket has been updated, including status\
    \ changes. A basic set of states of a trouble ticket has been specified (as an\
    \ example) to handle trouble ticket lifecycle management.\nTrouble Ticketing API\
    \ manages trouble ticket resource:\n\n  -\tA trouble ticket represents a record,\
    \ or an issue raised by requestor that need to be solved, used for reporting and\
    \ managing the resolution of problems, incidents or request -\tMain trouble ticket\
    \ attributes are its description, severity, type, related dates (creation, expected\
    \ resolution, resolution), state and related information (change reason and change\
    \ date), related parties (originator, owner, reviser, etc.), related entities\
    \ (product, product order, customer bill) and notes Trouble Ticket API performs\
    \ the following operations on trouble ticket -\tRetrieval of a trouble ticket\
    \ or a collection of trouble ticket depending on filter criteria -\tPartial update\
    \ of a trouble ticket -\tCreation of a trouble ticket -\tNotification of events\
    \ on trouble ticket: o\tTrouble ticket state change o\tTrouble ticket change o\t\
    Trouble ticket resoled o\tTrouble ticket created o\tTrouble ticket Information\
