    description: "## TMF API Reference: TMF 678 - Customer bill Management\n\n### Release:\
    \ 19.5 - December 2019\n\nThe Customer Bill Management API allows to find and\
    \ retrieve one or several customer bills (also called invoices) produced for a\
    \ customer. A customer bill is an electronic or paper document produced at the\
    \ end of the billing process. The customer bill gathers and displays different\
    \ items (applied customer billing rates generated during the rating and billing\
    \ processes) to be charged to a customer. It represents a total amount due for\
    \ all the products during the billing period and all significant information like\
    \ dates, bill reference...\nThis API provides also operations to find and retrieve\
    \ the details of applied customer billing rates presented on a customer bill.\
    \ \nFinally, this API allows to request in real-time a customer bill creation\
    \ and to manage this request.\n\n### Resources \n- customerBill\n- appliedCustomerBillingRate\n\
    - customerBillOnDemand\n- billingCycle\n\n### Operations\nCustomer Bill Management\
    \ API performs the following operations :\n- Retrieve a customer bill or a collection\
    \ of customer bills depending on filter criteria.\n- Partial update of  a customer\
    \ bill (for administration purposes).\n-  Retrieve an applied customer billing\
    \ rate or a collection of applied customer billing rates depending on filter criteria.\n\
    -  Create a customer bill on demand request, retrieve one or a collection of \
    \ customer bill on demand request(s) depending on filter criteria.\n\n- Manage\
    \ notification of events on customer bill and customer bill on demand.\n\nCopyright\
