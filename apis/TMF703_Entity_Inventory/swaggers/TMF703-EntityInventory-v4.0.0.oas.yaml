    description: "## TMF API Reference : TMF 703 - Entity Inventory \n\n Version 4.0\
    \ \n\nThe intent of this API is to provide a consistent/standardized mechanism\
    \ to query and manipulate the Entity inventory.\n\nThe Entity Inventory API can\
    \ be used to query the Entity and Association instances. \n Note: The Entity Inventory\
    \ API can be called by an order management system to create new Entity/Association\
    \ instances or update existing Entity/Association instances in the Entity Inventory.\n\
    \n### Entity/Association resources\n\n### Entity Inventory API performs the following\
    \ operations on Entity/Association resources :\n- Retrieve  an Entity/Association\
    \ or a collection of Entities/Associations depending on filter criteria\n- Partial\
    \ update of an Entity/Association instance (including updating rules)\n- Create\
    \ an Entity/Association instance (including default values and creation rules)\n\
    - Delete an Entity/Association (for administration users only)\n- Notification\
    \ of events on Entity/Association \n it should be noted that the Entity resource\
    \ can be considered as an abstract resource that extended by a concrete Managed\
    \ Entity resource in this API\n\nCopyright (c)TM Forum 2020. All Rights Reserved."

                Association is the class that describes a relationship between two or more entities or entity specifications based on a given association specification (relationship type). The role of each endpoint in the relationship is given by an association role. The type of endpoints in the relationship should match the ones as defined in the corresponding association role specification.
                 A relationship between entity/ entity specifications may be governed by conditions and rules which are addressed by constraint references in this resource. Constraints for a relationship may include new rules and conditions in addition to those defined for the corresponding association specification
