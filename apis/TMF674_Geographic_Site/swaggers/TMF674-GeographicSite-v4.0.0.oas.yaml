        ## TMF API Reference : TMF 674 - Place - Geographic Site Management
        
        ### Release : 19.5 - November 2019
        
        This API covers the operations to manage (create, read, delete) sites that can be associated to a customer, an account, a service delivery or other entities. It defines a Site as a convenience class that allows to easily refer to places important to other entities, where a geographic place is the entity that can answer the question “where?”, allowing to determine where things are in relation to the earth's surface, and can be represented either in a textual structured way (geographic address) or as a geometry referred to a spatial reference system (geographic location).
